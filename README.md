# Retirement Calculator
https://retirement-calc-cs50.herokuapp.com/
I built this retirement calculator for the final project in Harvard's CS50 class.

## How it works
This web application allows users to enter in their desired information and lets them view a basic overview of what their retirement finances could look like. This program can be launched using the link above or using flask from the terminal. If there are any problems with the calculation please send an email to brentperez97@gmail.com.

## How to run with flask
1. Clone or download repository from https://github.com/BrentPerez/retirement_calc
2. `$ python3 -m venv venv`
3. `$ source venv/bin/activate`
4. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `$ flask run`
6. Now flask should be running the website using a local server ctrl+click on it to open in your web browser.
